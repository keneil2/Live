# React-like Library (Work in Progress) 🚀  

This is my attempt to create a library similar to **React**. So far, I have implemented a basic `CreateElement` class, which allows you to create elements with props for content. While it's not as powerful as React yet, I'm proud of the progress I've made!  

## Features So Far 🎉  
1. **`CreateElement` Class**:  
   - Can handle props, but only for **content** at the moment.  
   - Designed with simplicity in mind.  
2. **HTML Parsing**:  
   - Can parse HTML but with limitations (e.g., no support for self-closing tags or JavaScript expressions).  
3. **Tailwind CSS Ready**:  
   - To style components, simply add the **Tailwind CDN** link to your `index.php` file.  

## To-Do List 🛠️  
Here are the next steps to improve the library:  
- [ ] Add support for **self-closing tags** in the parser.  
- [ ] Implement support for **JavaScript expressions** in JSX-like syntax.  
- [ ] Enhance `CreateElement` to handle all **props**, not just content.  
- [ ] Add proper error handling for invalid HTML syntax.  

## How to Use 💡  
1. Include the **Tailwind CSS CDN** in your `index.php`:  
   ```html
   <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
2.  When you open the project in your terminal if you have php install just run `php -S localhost:port` ( you can use port 8000 if you want)
3. go the the url in your terminal and you should be okay after that

## Remember its not perfect I only have 1 year learning exp with php and a little js so my code is sh*it 🤣
